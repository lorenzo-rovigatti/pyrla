# Example of an input_example for pyrla
# This file will launch 6 jobs at once (one for each unique 
# combination of temperatures and activities). Each job will run 
# in a separate directory (that will be created at runtime) 
# whose name is indicated in the DirectoryStructure key. In each 
# directory will be created a file named as in the CopyTo key. 
# This file will contain the lines found in the CopyFrom file 
# with the keys in CopyToWrite overwritten or appended at the 
# end. In each directory the Execute command will be issued.
# The number of parallel jobs ran will be 3 (as stated in the
# ContemporaryJobs key). pyrla will launch a job every 0.5s.
